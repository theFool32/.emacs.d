# What is color-rg?
color-rg is a search and refactoring tool based on ripgrep.

I'm a big fan of color-moccur.el, this extension's name is a tribute to color-moccur.el!

## Installation
Clone or download this repository (path of the folder is the `<path-to-color-rg>` used below).

In your `~/.emacs`, add the following two lines:
```Elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-color-rg>") ; add color-rg to your load-path
(require 'color-rg)
```

If you use Mac, you also need to install [exec-path-from-shell](https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell)

### Work with isearch
Add this into your emacs config file:
```
(define-key isearch-mode-map (kbd "M-s M-s") 'isearch-toggle-color-rg)
```
When using `isearch-forward', type "M-s M-s" to search current isearch string with color-rg.

### Research with new files
`color-rg-rerun-change-files` can limit search files with
GLOB. This function used rg arguments '--type', '--add-type'.

Default search files is "everything" which means use rg without '--type' argument.

If search files is "all", search rg like "rg --type all".

Other complete candidates are mostly read from "rg --type-list"
command, which is predefined in rg.

Of course you can specify your own GLOB, just insert them as you
like. For example, if you input a GLOB like `*mypersonalglob*`, which
match none of the candidates, then, color-rg will call shell command
like:
```
"rg --add-type 'custom:*mypersonalglob*' --type custom ..."
```

### Research with customized arguments
If none of the preset meet your requirements,
`color-rg-customized-search` can release the full power of `rg`.

When `color-rg-customized-search` is called,
the full command of rg will show up, and you can add any argument to rg as in shell.

you must escape special characters when using `color-rg-customized-search`,
for example:

```
rg --type-add custom\:\*.el
# or
rg --type-add 'custom:*.el'
# or
rg --type-add "custom:*.el"
```
