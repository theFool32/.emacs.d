# SPC-M-EMACS

This configuration is inspired by [M-EMACS](https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d) and [Centaur](https://github.com/seagle0128/.emacs.d).
It combines these two configurations and provides a Spacemacs-like experience.

It is compatible **Only with Emacs 26 and above**.

```bash
# install with:
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/theFool32/.emacs.d.git

```

Enjoy hacking!
